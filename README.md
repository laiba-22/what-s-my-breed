# What's My Breed
## Description: 
This project implements convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to classify cat and dog breeds from images. The trained model will, hopefully, be deployed on a mobile app for real-time detection.


## Core Functionality: 
- Real-time breed recognition via camera
- Breed recognition from static image/video
- Display animal (cat/dog) and breed name
- Future: Display breed info + fun stats
